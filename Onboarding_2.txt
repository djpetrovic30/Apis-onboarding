50. Why do we perform paired-end sequencing?
  Paired-end sequencing allows users to sequence both ends of a fragment and generate high-quality, alignable sequence data.
  Paired-end DNA sequencing reads provide high-quality alignment across DNA regions containing repetitive sequences, and produce long contigs for de novo sequencing by filling gaps in the consensus sequence.
  Also detects common DNA rearrangements such as insertions, deletions, and inversions.
