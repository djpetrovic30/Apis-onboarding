11. What is the difference between an adenoma and a carcinoma? 
b. A carcinoma is typically malignant while a adenoma is benign. 
c. Both are tumors.

12. Explain what is a signaling cascade or a signaling pathway.
a. Signal transduction from outside the cell, that leads to a pathway of protein activations eventually leading to mitosis.
