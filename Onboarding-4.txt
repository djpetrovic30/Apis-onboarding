17. Base Recalibration is performed because....
 a. Sequencers can produce overconfident base quality scores

18. De-duplication of reads is performed because.....
 a. duplicate reads mess up coverage of loci and thus variant calling

19. If we want to view FASTQ read statistics we must pass our FASTQ file through which of the following tools?
 a. FASTQmcf
 b. FASTQC
 c. FASTQH ???

20. FASTQ read quality scores are expected to decrease base by base. 
 a. True

21. What is the difference between empirical quality scores and reported quality scores?
 b. Empirical quality scores are mapping scores while reported scores are base call scores.
 
22. How many possible covariates are there for base quality score recalibration?
 a. 3
 b. 4
 c. 5  ???

23. We recalibrate our base quality scores in order to reduces the qualities of overconfident base calls. 
 a. True i think

24. We use databases such as dbSNP to detect and recalibrate base quality score errors. 
 a. True i think

25. Why is it important to do INDEL realignment first before base quality score recalibration?
 a. base quality scoring takes mismatches into context, realignment may resolve previously detected mismatches

fluorescent nucleotide is a repetition of question 26. 
 a. True
 b. False ???

28. Systematic errors during iLLUMINA sequencing where terminating groups seise to detach themselves from labeled nucleotides result in
DELETIONS. 
 a. True
 b. False ???
